With LandscapeLab!, spatial planning games can be developed on the basis of geodata. The game logic can consist of excluded and potential areas that have a corresponding effect on the achievement of the game goal. On the game board, players can follow the progress towards the goal.",

Therefore, the LandscapeLab! uses simple game tokens that are placed on an interactive board. The tokens are translated into corresponding computer actions with the help of object recognition.

The position, shape and colour of the game pieces are recorded by a camera and evaluated in the course of an object recognition process with the help of OpenCV and translated into corresponding computer actions. In this way, various game sequences and planning processes can be realised in groups based on spatial data.",

The player position and assets (e.g. planned wind turbines) can be transferred via a simple REST interface - for example from the interactive game table.<br>The landscape can be observed and changed in different views. It is possible to switch to the VR view at any time in order to immerse oneself directly in the landscape.<br>In addition, VR-GIS functionalities have also been integrated. This allows not only visualisations, but also analyses and interactions in the 3D VR tool. Planners can use different tools in the virtual environment to observe - for example, distance measuring - or modify the landscape.",
