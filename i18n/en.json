    "gaming": "If life, <a href=\"https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rien_ne_va_plus_(film,_1997)\" target=\"_blank\">following Claude Chabrol</a>, is a game, then planning should be too. With LandscapeLab!, spatial planning games can be developed on the basis of geodata. The game logic can consist of excluded and potential areas that have a corresponding effect on the achievement of the game goal. On the game board, players can follow the progress towards the goal.",
    
    "hl-mmi": "Human-Machine Interaction",
    "mmi": "How does a group operate a computer with a keyboard and a mouse? We think it's best not to. Therefore, the LandscapeLab! uses simple game tokens that are placed on an interactive board. The tokens are translated into corresponding computer actions with the help of object recognition. These actions are group-dynamic and physical-haptic processes that promote interaction, rather than inhibit it.",
    
    "hl-vr": "Virtual Reality Assessment",
    "vr": "Planning addresses the future and the picture of this future often appears fuzzy and unclear. To sharpen this picture, we use GIS-based interactive 3D visualisations with virtual reality to present the visual impact of a planning project as comprehensively as possible."
